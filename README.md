Waset is the experimental repository for some of the genuine digital material cooked for the archaeological map of Western Thebes project.

Those materials are derived from several kind of sources : archaeological publications (plans, maps), satellite imagery, on field GPS surveys, photographs, and are elaborated thank to open source softwares such as QGIS, MeshLab, CloudCompare, Micmac etc.

By sharing these files, I attempt to improve the exchange of data between the people involved in the archaeological research in Luxor, Western Thebes, especially trying to share a common georeferenced system, because the site currently lacks such data.

Please feel free to contact me regarding this matter at alban.pimpaud@gmail.com
